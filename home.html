						<h3>What is Adobe Illustrator?</h3>
						<p>
							Adobe Illustrator is a Creative Cloud software application for creating drawings, illustrations, and artwork 
							using a Windows or MacOS computer. Illustrator is widely used by graphic designers, web designers, 
							visual artists, and more throughout the world to create high quality artwork. Illustrator contains many 
							sophisticated tools that help reduce the time needed to create the illustrations, such as the import 
							function, which allows the user to import photographs and/or images that help guide the user when creating 
							the illustration.

						<h3>Tools in Adobe Illustrator</h3>
							<section id="toolbars">
							  <p>In Adobe Illustrator, there are two types of toolbars:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>Basic</strong> - This toolbar appears by default and includes a 
										selective list of tools that you will frequently need in Illustrator.
										Click on the <a id="editText" href="#aiToolbar"><img id="editTool" src="Images/Bitmaps/EditToolbar.bmp" alt="EditToolbar image is unavailable"> Edit Toolbar icon</a> 
										at the bottom of the toolbar to view the All Tools drawer containing all the tools 
										available in Illustrator.						
									</li>
								</ul>	
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>Advanced</strong> - This toolbar contains all the tools available in Illustrator.						
									</li>
								</ul>	
								<ul id="allTools">
									<li>
										To switch between toolbars, do one of the following:						
									</li>
									<li>
										Choose <strong>Windows &gt;&gt; Toolbars</strong>.						
									</li>
									<li>
										Select the toolbar through the <a id="flyText" href="#aiAllTools"><img id="flyOut" src="Images/Bitmaps/FlyoutMenu.bmp" alt="FlyoutMenu image is unavailable"> flyout menu</a> inside the All Tools drawer.						
									</li>
								</ul>							
							</section>
						<p>We will cover several most frequently used tools in the Illustrator toolbar:</p>
						<section id="coverTools">
							<p>
								<strong>
									*NOTE: Right-clicking the tools with an arrow at the bottom right corner will 
									allow the user to see more related tools, however we will not be covering them in this guide.*
								</strong>

								<li>
									<a id="penText" href="#aiPen"><img id="pen" class="imgTools" src="Images/Bitmaps/Pen.bmp" alt="Pen image is unavailable"><strong>Pen Tool</strong></a> 
									<p>
										<div class="brief">
											It's shortcut key is (P), or [shift + P]. The Pen tool uses anchor points to draw straight and curved 
											lines to create objects. Note that while both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator has this tool, 
											Illustrator's pen tool features anchor guidelines to help create straight lines and align with
											a particular straight part of an object.										
										</div>
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>	
							<ul id="coverRect">
								<li>
									<a id="rectText" href="#aiRect"><img id="rect" class="imgTools" src="Images/Bitmaps/Rect.bmp" alt="Rectangle image is unavailable"><strong>Rectangle Tool</strong></a> 
									<p>
										<div class="brief">

											<ul><li>To draw a rectangle, drag diagonally until the rectangle reaches the desired size.</li></ul>
											<ul><li>To draw a square, hold down the Shift key and drag diagonally until the square reaches the desired size.</li></ul>
											<ul>
												<li>
													To create a square or rectangle using values, click anywhere you want without dragging to open up a pop up box. 
													Then specify a width and height and click OK.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<ul id="coverEye">
