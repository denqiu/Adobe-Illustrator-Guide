# Adobe-Illustrator-Guide
# The final project for my CIT204 course, Digital Media.
# It is a website to guide the viewer on several basic tools in Adobe Illustrator. The website offers an exercise the viewer can try on their own time.
# Before this website was started, a storyboard was created. There is an updated version of the storyboard as well.
# Since the website is unpublished, the final project is a video presentation of the website. 
# Due to Hurricane Florence, some parts of the video presentation was rushed and looks a little incomplete.
